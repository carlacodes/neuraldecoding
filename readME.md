# LSTMS on auditory cortex data <br>

this repo forms the bulk of my neural data analysis on auditory cortical spiking activity -- I run a shallow LSTM using Keras (only one hidden layer) and find auditory cortex neurons in trained animals 
become more discriminable towards a target word (stimulus representing reward) over competing non-target probe words (stimuli w/no associated meaning). <br>
Apologies in advance as this repo is still currently a mess. I will be cleaning it up soon. <br>
